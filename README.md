<h1> The Psychic Guessing Game </h1>
<p>
<hr>

**This is How The Game Works**
In this game the user has nine attempts to guess a random letter picked by the game.

If the user selects the right letter [key] the game will let them know that they **Win**; and increase the number of Wins.

If they select the wrong letter [key] the user will be notified that they have lost a guess up to nine guesses. On the ninth incorrect guesses and the user has not picked the right letter [key] the user will be notified that they have **Lost** the game, by increasing the Losses.

If the user selects an incorrect number the game will also indicate:
(1) How many guesses they have left
(2) The letters [keys] that were already selected by the user
(3) If the user selects the same key more than once, the game will not deduct a guess from their pool of guesses. Nor will it add the letter again to the list of letters selected

After the user Wins or Lose a game a fresh game will start with nine new attempts/guesses awarded
